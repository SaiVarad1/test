# 2.8-9 Algorithms of Machine Learning

## Types of Algorithms
Depends on type of use-case
1. Regression (Supervised Learning)
    * Applied when output is continuous number
    * Decision Tree
        * Predicts continuous values like price of a house
        * CART- Classification And Regression Tree
        * Represents a single input variable (x) and a split point on that variable
2. Classification(SL)
    * Applied when output has finite and discrete values 
        * Eg: Positive, Negative, Neutral
3. Clustering/Dimensionality Reduction
4. Association Analysis
