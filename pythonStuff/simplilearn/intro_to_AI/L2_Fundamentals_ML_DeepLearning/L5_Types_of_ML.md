# 2.5-7 Types of ML

Approach chosen based on structure and volume of data available, regardless of use case.
## Supervised Learning  
* Is provided with training data and expected output or rules for categorization (labels)
* Uses set of input and output to predict output for future unseen inputs
## Unsupervised Learning
* Learns from unlabelled training dataset
* is expected to find patterns and anomalies
* fraud detection, customer analysis, MRI, Image Identification
## Semi-Supervised Learning
* Hybrid 
* uses both labelled and unlabelled data
* Eg: Webpage Topics Categorization

## Reinforcement Learning
* Learning system that observes the environment and learns ideal behavior
* Selects and takes certain actions, and receives rewards/penalties
* Receives feedback in a loop
* Learns the strategy to maximize reward
* Eg: Robot walking
