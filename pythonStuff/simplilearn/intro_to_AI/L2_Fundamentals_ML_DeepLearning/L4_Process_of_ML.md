# 2.4 Process of Machine Learning

* Leverages existing data, images, and videos to train algos and models
* sets of example (training sets) are fed into the system
    * each item in training set is labelled 0 or 1

ML Process is divided into Training and Testing

## Training
### 1. Labelled Training Data
    * Input Data + Expected Output
### 2. Machine Learning Algorithm
    * Algorithm studies data patterns and works out logic
### 3. Learned Model
    * Used with test data sets
## Testing
1. Input Data
    * Generates output based on logic derived from training data
2. Learned Model
    * Classifies test data based on the patterns learned from training data
3. Predictions
    * Uses patterns from the test data and logic of learned model to make predictons and derive output
