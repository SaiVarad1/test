# 2.3 Relationship between Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis

## Machine Learning
* Subset of AI in CS
* associated with High-dimensional data
* Takes away deterministic function f out of the equation
    * Input (X)----> Output(Y)
## Statistical Analysis
* Mathematics
* Deals with finding relationship between variables to predict an outcome
* Deals with low  dimensional data
* Tries to estimate function f
    * Dependent Variable(Y) = f(Independent Variable) + Error Function
