# Lesson 1.3 Three Stages of AI

There are three stages of AI: ANI, AGI, ASI

### At a glance:

* ANI- User-driven big data systems for machine learning
* AGI- Advanced networds trained to build ad-hoc systems and improve themselves using data
* ASI- Machine Consciousness- Systems characterizing cognitive self-learning


## Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI)
* Limited to one/two functional areas of the brain
* Not self-aware/conscious
* Appear to be making decisions, but just stats and maths
* Eg: Smartphone apps, chess, image identification tools, speech recog, self driving etc


## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* Cover more than one functional area (reasoning,prob solving, abstract thinking)
* Examples include Multipurpose systems, human-level intelligence systems, systems deciding action/ synthesizing info


## Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
* Surpass human intelligence
* Eg: AI agents
