# Lesson 2.6 Data Analytics Conclusion or Predictions


## TLDR
* If there is a difference, alternative hypo is accepted
* If there is no difference between sample means, null hypo is accepted

## Hypothesis Testing:
* Draw two samples from the population and calculate the difference between their means
## Alternative Hypothesis
    Proposed Model outcome is accurate and matches the data. There is a difference between the means of S1 and S2

## Null Hypothesis
    There is no difference between the means of sample 1 and 2

## Hypothesis Testing Process

* Choosing the training and test dataset and evaluating them with the null and alternative hypothesis

* Null Hypo is accepted when proposed model does not predict better than existing model
* Else alternative hypothesis is accepted
* Training dataset: 60-80%, Testing Datset: 20-40%
